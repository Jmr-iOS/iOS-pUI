@section 	Programmatic UI Content Use
	Projects are left to ZIP until needed for use. Extracted on use & used for ref until complete. This is performed to mitigate
	XCode's magical, mysterious use of file referencing and hierarchies, which baffles us at this time and is mitigated at all costs.
	
@section 	Programmatic UI Naming
	0_0 for all standard UIKit content	 (e.g. UITextView)
	0_1! for all programming content 	 (e.g. class extensions)
	0_2! for all standard iOS ui content (e.g. Music or the Keyboard, PDFs)
	1_0 for all example content 		 (e.g. database uses, file writing)
		*Use simplest naming when possible (e.g. UISwitch, Music, etc.)
